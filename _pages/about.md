I am an 2nd year graduate student at MIT EECS advised by Prof. Antonio Torralba.  In my research, I aim to explore in-depth the capabilities of using multiple modalities of information, few shot-learning, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. The questions that I seek to answer are: how to model the real world, how to leverage data in intelligent systems to be able to generalize to new environments, how to deal with sparse data, what can we achieve with transfer learning and few-shot learning? 

I studied mathematics at the University of Vienna and The Autonomous University of Barcelona. After finishing my studies I had the pleasure to work at [Twenty Billion Neurons](https://20bn.com/) as an A.I. Engineer. More recently I graduated from a MSc in Computer Science at the University of Oxford and did a research internship at the Torr Vision Group.
