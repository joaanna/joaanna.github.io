I am an incoming graduate student at MIT EECS advised by Prof. Antonio Torralba.  In my research, I aim to explore in-depth the capabilities of using multiple modalities of information, few shot-learning, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. The questions that I seek to answer are: how to model the real world, how to leverage the data in intelligent systems to be able to generalize to new environments, how to deal with sparse data, what can we achieve with transfer learning and few-shot learning?
